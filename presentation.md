# LegisCompare AI: 5-Minute Hackathon Pitch

## Slide 1: Title Slide (15 seconds)

**LegisCompare AI**

**Revolutionizing Legislative Analysis for a More Transparent Government**

## Slide 2: The Problem (45 seconds)

**The Challenge: Legislative Gridlock is Expensive and Opaque**

*   **Information Overload:** Governments process thousands of bills annually. Each one is dense and complex.
*   **Time is Money:** Staffers spend countless hours manually comparing document versions. This is slow, error-prone, and expensive.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** It's nearly impossible for citizens, or even other departments, to understand the real-world impact of legislative changes.
*   **The Cost:** This inefficiency wastes thousands of staff hours, delays policy, and erodes public trust.

## Slide 3: The Solution (30 seconds)

**LegisCompare AI: From Hours to Seconds**

We've built an AI-powered platform that transforms legislative analysis. It semantically understands changes between two versions of a document and generates an instant, actionable report.

*   **Executive Summary:** High-level overview of critical changes.
*   **Stakeholder Impact:** Identifies who benefits and who is harmed.
*   **Impact Forecast:** Shows short, medium, and long-term consequences.
*   **Evidence-Based:** Every insight is backed by direct quotes.

Now, let's see it in action.

## Slide 4: Live Demonstration (1.5 minutes)

**(This is where you'll share your screen and walk through the application)**

1.  **Start on the homepage.** Briefly explain the UI.
2.  **Upload two files.** Use pre-selected, clear examples (e.g., `bill_v1.pdf`, `bill_v2.pdf`).
3.  **Initiate the analysis.** As it runs (it should be fast!), explain what's happening in the background: "Our FastAPI backend is extracting the text and sending it to OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for analysis."
4.  **Show the results page.**
    *   Point to the **Executive Summary**.
    *   Scroll to the **Stakeholder Analysis** and hover over the chart to show interactivity.
    *   Briefly show the **Impact Forecast** timeline.
    *   Highlight a **quote** to emphasize the evidence-based approach.

**Key message:** "In just a few clicks, we've done what would normally take a team of legislative aides hours or even days to complete."

## Slide 5: The Tech Stack (45 seconds)

**Built for Performance, Security, and Scale**

We used a modern, robust tech stack to build a production-ready solution.

*   **Frontend:** **Next.js 15** and **React 19** for a fast, modern UI, with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, professional design.
*   **Backend:** **Python** and **FastAPI** for a high-performance, scalable API.
*   **The "Brains":** **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** powers our semantic analysis, using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to ensure accuracy.

## Slide 6: The Ask & Vision (15 seconds)

**Our Vision: Transparent Governance, Powered by AI.**

We're seeking mentorship and pilot partners to bring this powerful tool to government agencies. Our goal is to create a more transparent, efficient, and trustworthy legislative process for everyone.

**Thank you!**
